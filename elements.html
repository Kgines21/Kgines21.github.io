								<p>Healthcare to the homeless population is quite difficult to perform. There are numerous issues to tackle with few resources. Akido provided help by reducing the amount of repeitive work by using AI to automate these tasks. </p>
								<p>To highlight one issue in particular was the amount of data being gathered and how difficult it was to record this information. With the current records system in place, using it outdoors and the mobile devices posed a large barrier. Load times would often take more than 5 seconds on most devices which led to low device usage and the healthcare workers opted for handwritten notes. Often times, the team would forget to record their information due to the large amount of patients that had to be seen. I recommeneded a notification system for them to help record this information and allow for cross team communication boosting the use of the EMR system by more than 3 times.</p>

								<p>One of the exiciting developments of Akido was the use of Voice to Text AI to automatically take notes from what the microphone picked up from the conversation. Using AWS technology, my job was to test how viable this technology could be used in this healthcare setting. My tests outlined the location, distance from the provider and patient, and how clear and accurate the generated plan would be. In a clinical setting - the results were great with clear and logically generated notes. However, in the field, multiple issues would arise with the main problem being picking up a patients style of speech. In addition, I tested the same Voice to text transcription with a competitor of AWS, Nabla as one of the providers was also using this technology. With the insights given, I relayed the pros and cons of why a provider would choose another service over theirs.</p>
